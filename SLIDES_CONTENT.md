## Slide 2: What is a Sonometer?
**Variant:** Content  
**Title:** What is a Sonometer?  
**Description:** A sonometer is a box with a stretched wire that vibrates when you make sound near it—like a guitar string. When the vibrations match a tuning fork's frequency perfectly, the wire vibrates hardest (resonance), and you can measure that exact frequency. By changing the wire's length or tension, you discover the simple rules that control all vibrating things:

**Key Points:**
- Longer wire = lower pitch
- Tighter wire = higher pitch

## Slide 3: Three Fundamental Principles
**Variant:** Dark  
**Title:** Three Fundamental Principles  
**Image:** standing-wave.png (right side, 60/40 layout)

### Standing Waves
When a vibrating wire is trapped between two fixed points, waves bounce back and forth and stack on top of each other, creating spots that barely move and spots that vibrate wildly. This pattern only happens at specific frequencies.

### Resonance
When the wire's natural vibration frequency matches the frequency of a tuning fork nearby, energy transfers perfectly and the wire vibrates with maximum amplitude (biggest swings). It's like pushing a swing at exactly the right moment—small pushes create huge motion.

### Wave Speed Relationship
Sound travels through the wire at a speed determined by how tight it is (tension) and how heavy it is (mass). Tighter wires = faster waves = higher pitch; heavier wires = slower waves = lower pitch.

## Slide 4: The Mathematics
**Variant:** Content  
**Title:** The Mathematics  
**Image:** maths.png (centered between header and description)  
**Description:** The formula f = (1/2L)√(T/μ) just captures this relationship: vibrations follow predictable patterns—same wire, same frequency, every time—whether it's a guitar string or a building shaking in wind.

**Key Insight:**
> Find something's natural frequency, and you control it. Tighter control of resonance = tighter control of reality.

## Slide 7: Closing Slide
**Variant:** Title  
**Title:** The big idea:  
**Description:** A sonometer shows us that invisible phenomena follow predictable patterns. With just a wire, a box, and weights, we can measure sound and prove the math.  
**Footer:** Physics isn't abstract—it's everywhere.
